# Inventonater Rules

A tiny weekend rules engine that lets JSON-defined triggers, conditions, and actions drive Unity services.

## Features
- Event, numeric threshold, time schedule, and pattern sequence triggers
- State equals and numeric compare conditions
- Service call, wait duration, repeat count, and stop actions
- Desktop input and basic services (audio, log, toast, state.set)

See `Samples~/Demo` for example rules.
