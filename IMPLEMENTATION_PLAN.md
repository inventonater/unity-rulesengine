# Unity Rules Engine - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Building a high-performance Event-Condition-Action (ECA) automation system for Quest VR applications that enables LLM-generated rules to control VR interactions. The system will support complex temporal patterns, spatial queries, and stateful workflows while maintaining deterministic performance suitable for 72-120Hz VR requirements.

## Architecture Decision: Standalone C# Core with Unity Adapter

### Rationale for Separation

We're implementing the core rules engine as a standalone C# project (.NET Standard 2.1) with a separate Unity adapter layer. This decision is based on several critical factors:

**Development Velocity**
- Unit tests run in milliseconds vs Unity's 10+ second domain reload
- Standard .NET tooling provides better debugging and profiling capabilities
- No Unity license required for CI/CD pipeline testing
- Faster iteration with `dotnet watch test` for TDD workflow

**Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Clean separation of concerns between business logic and Unity-specific implementation
- Enforces proper abstraction and dependency injection patterns
- Portable core that could be reused in server environments or other platforms
- Better IntelliSense and refactoring support in standard C# projects

**Testing Strategy**
- Core logic can be thoroughly unit tested without Unity overhead
- Mocking is straightforward with interface-based design
- Integration tests can focus specifically on Unity adapter behavior
- Performance benchmarks can run in isolation

### Dependency Analysis

**Core Dependencies (Standalone Compatible)**
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: Industry standard JSON parsing, works everywhere
- **R3 (Reactive Extensions)**: Has .NET Standard version for complex event patterns
- **System.Numerics**: For vector math without Unity dependency

**Unity-Specific Dependencies (Adapter Layer Only)**
- **UniTask**: Superior async for Unity, adapts to standard Task/ValueTask
- **Meta XR SDK**: Quest input and haptics, abstracted behind interfaces
- **Unity.Mathematics**: Can be replaced with System.Numerics in core

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine (Standalone C#)

**Goal**: Build the foundational rules engine with zero Unity dependencies, fully testable in isolation.

**Key Components**:
- **Data Models**: Define AutomationRule, Trigger, Condition, Action as POCOs
- **JSON Deserialization**: Implement polymorphic type discrimination safely (avoiding TypeNameHandling security risks)
- **Event System**: R3-based reactive streams for temporal operators (throttle, debounce, combine)
- **Condition Evaluator**: Interpreter pattern for evaluating conditions without runtime code generation
- **Action Executor**: Async/await based execution with proper cancellation support
- **State Management**: Immutable state updates with change notifications

**Testing Approach**: Comprehensive unit tests for each component, property-based testing for condition evaluator, integration tests for rule loading and execution.

### Phase 2: Unity Integration Layer

**Goal**: Bridge the core engine to Unity/Quest specific functionality while maintaining separation.

**Key Components**:
- **Service Adapters**: IHapticService, ISpatialQuery, ISpawnService implementations
- **UniTask Adapters**: Convert between Task and UniTask at boundaries
- **Quest Input Bridge**: Transform OVRInput events into R3 streams
- **Spatial Queries**: Implement proximity/zone conditions using Unity physics
- **Hand Tracking**: Gesture detection using Meta Hand Tracking API

**Testing Approach**: Unity Test Framework for integration tests, mock Quest inputs for automated testing, performance profiling on actual Quest hardware.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

**Goal**: Add sophisticated capabilities while maintaining performance targets.

**Key Features**:
- **JSONPath Templates**: Dynamic value resolution using "{{ $.path }}" syntax
- **Variable System**: Scoped variables within automation context
- **Execution Modes**: Single, queued, restart, parallel with proper cancellation
- **Complex Triggers**: Gesture sequences, combinations, time windows
- **Hot Reload**: Development-time rule reloading without restart

### Phase 4: Production Optimization

**Goal**: Ensure Quest performance requirements are met (<0.5ms evaluation time).

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse contexts and temporary objects
- **Struct-based Events**: Avoid allocations in hot path
- **Compiled Conditions**: Optional bytecode compilation for complex rules
- **Profiling**: Unity Profiler and Memory Profiler validation
- **IL2CPP Testing**: Verify all features work with AOT compilation

## Technical Constraints & Mitigations

### Quest VR Specific Challenges

**Performance Constraints**
- Mobile ARM processor (Snapdragon XR2) with ~1/10th desktop CPU power
- 11-13ms total frame budget at 72-90Hz
- Garbage collection causes frame drops

**Mitigation**: Zero-allocation design in hot path, object pooling, struct-based data flow

**IL2CPP/AOT Restrictions**
- No runtime code generation (Expression.Compile, dynamic keyword)
- Limited reflection capabilities
- Generic virtual method constraints

**Mitigation**: Interpreter pattern for conditions, avoid expression trees, test on device frequently

### Memory Management

**Challenge**: Quest 2/3 have limited RAM (6-8GB total, 2-3GB available)

**Solution**: 
- Lazy load rules only when needed
- Compile JSON to efficient runtime format
- Pool all temporary allocations
- Use structs for events and small data

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: <0.5ms rule evaluation on Quest hardware
2. **Reliability**: Zero crashes in 1-hour continuous operation
3. **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage on core engine
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reload working, clear error messages
5. **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent rules without degradation

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

1. **R3 Performance on Quest**: While R3 is optimized, complex observable chains might allocate
   - *Mitigation*: Profile early, limit operator complexity, consider custom implementations

2. **JSON Parsing Overhead**: Large rule files could cause frame drops
   - *Mitigation*: Parse at load time only, consider binary format for production

3. **IL2CPP Compatibility**: Some C# features might not work as expected
   - *Mitigation*: Test on device weekly, maintain IL2CPP compatibility list

### Schedule Risks

1. **Unity Integration Complexity**: Adapter layer might be more complex than estimated
   - *Mitigation*: Start with minimal adapters, add features incrementally

2. **Performance Optimization Time**: May require more optimization than planned
   - *Mitigation*: Set clear performance budgets, profile continuously

## Deliverables

### Core Engine Package
- Standalone C# library with zero Unity dependencies
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- API documentation

### Unity Integration Package
- Unity-specific adapters and helpers
- Quest input bridge
- Example scenes demonstrating features

### Documentation
- Architecture overview

- Troubleshooting common issues

## Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, especially for core logic
2. **Interface-Based Design**: All Unity dependencies behind interfaces
3. **Immutable Data Flow**: Prevent side effects and race conditions
4. **Fail-Fast**: Clear error messages at rule load time, not runtime
5. **Performance Budget**: Every feature must fit within frame time constraints

## Conclusion

This architecture provides the best balance of development velocity, code quality, and runtime performance. The standalone core ensures we can iterate quickly with confidence, while the Unity adapter layer gives us full access to Quest-specific features. The clean separation will pay dividends in testing, maintenance, and potential future platform support.
