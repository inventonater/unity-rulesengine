Absolutely—there’s a solid “off‑the‑shelf” stack you can combine instead of building an Event‑Condition‑Action system from scratch in Unity (with JSON + Newtonsoft). Here’s a curated, Unity/VR‑friendly set, plus what each piece buys you.

---

## My recommended stack (quick read)

* **Rules + JSON config:** **Microsoft RulesEngine** — evaluates JSON‑defined rules, supports nested rules, “actions,” and extensible C# expressions. MIT‑licensed. ([GitHub][1], [Microsoft GitHub][2])
* **Event wiring & temporal patterns:** **UniRx** *or* **R3** (Cysharp) — Observables in Unity to compose inputs (debounce, buffer, window, double‑tap, hold, etc.). Both MIT‑licensed and Unity‑oriented. ([GitHub][3])
* **In‑process event bus:** **MessagePipe** — high‑performance Pub/Sub and mediator for Unity; great for decoupling event producers from your rule engine/actions. MIT‑licensed. ([GitHub][4], [NuGet][5])
* **JSON schema validation (at load time):** **NJsonSchema** (MIT) — validate your rules JSON; prefer this over Newtonsoft’s commercial schema add‑on unless you specifically want that product. ([GitHub][6], [NuGet][7], [newtonsoft.com][8])
* **Condition evaluators (AOT‑safe fallback):** **JsonLogic.Net** *(JSON‑Logic grammar, depends on Newtonsoft.Json)* or **NCalc** *(string expressions with custom functions)*—both MIT; useful if you want to avoid expression compilation on IL2CPP. ([GitHub][9], [NuGet][10])
* **Stateful flows (optional):** **Stateless** for finite state machines, or **NPBehave** for behavior trees if your “A” side benefits from stateful orchestration. MIT‑licensed. ([GitHub][11])
* **Input capture:** Unity **Input System** package as your raw event source. ([GitHub][12])

---

## How these fit together

1. **Capture & normalize events**
   Use the **Input System** to read controller/gesture events; publish them on **MessagePipe** channels and map to **UniRx/R3** observables. With observables you can express temporal patterns declaratively (e.g., *pinch and hold ≥300 ms*, *double press within 200 ms*, *swipe + gaze‑on‑target*). ([GitHub][12])

2. **Evaluate conditions**
   For each ECA rule, your **condition** can be:

   * a **RulesEngine** expression (C#‑like lambda in JSON), or
   * a **JsonLogic.Net** rule, or
   * an **NCalc** formula,
     fed with the current “context” (headset state, app mode, proximity, confidence scores). ([Microsoft GitHub][2], [GitHub][9])

3. **Trigger actions**
   **RulesEngine** has built‑in “Actions” and a hook for **custom actions**—perfect for invoking your Unity behaviors (UI updates, object selection, RPCs). Keep action implementations modular and publish results/side‑effects via **MessagePipe** to avoid tight coupling. ([Microsoft GitHub][2])

4. **Validate and hot‑reload JSON**
   Validate rule files with **NJsonSchema** when you load them. If you want a visual editor, there’s a community **RulesEngineEditor** (Blazor) you can adapt or use out‑of‑process. ([GitHub][6])

## Notable options & when to use them

* **Microsoft RulesEngine (MIT)** — JSON rules, nested rules, scoped params, and pluggable actions. A great centerpiece if you want declarative JSON with extensible C# expressions and built‑in orchestration. ([GitHub][1], [Microsoft GitHub][2])
* **UniRx / R3** — Proven in Unity for composing input streams; ideal for detecting time‑based/sequence patterns without lots of bespoke code. ([GitHub][3])
* **MessagePipe** — Simple, fast Pub/Sub for Unity; keeps your input, rules, and action systems cleanly separated. ([GitHub][4])
* **JsonLogic.Net (MIT)** — Pure JSON condition language (portable across ecosystems), depends on Newtonsoft.Json; good for **AOT/IL2CPP**. ([GitHub][9])
* **NCalc (MIT)** — Small, embeddable expression evaluator; add custom functions for app‑specific predicates. Also **AOT‑friendly**. ([GitHub][13])
* **Stateless (MIT)** — Lightweight C# state machine; useful if some actions need explicit modes/guards beyond one‑shot rules. ([GitHub][11])
* **NPBehave (MIT)** — Event‑driven behavior trees; nice for complex, stateful action flows. ([GitHub][14])
* **NRules (MIT)** — Rete‑based rules engine authored in C# (internal DSL). Powerful for fact‑based reasoning, but less JSON‑config‑friendly out of the box. ([GitHub][15], [NRules][16])
* **NEsper (GPLv2)** — Complex Event Processing (CEP) with EPL queries; heavy but very capable. GPL licensing usually makes it a non‑starter for closed‑source Unity apps. ([GitHub][17], [EsperTech][18])

---

## Unity/IL2CPP gotchas (important)

* **AOT + dynamic code**: IL2CPP disallows JIT and the C# `dynamic` keyword. Libraries that *compile* expression trees to IL at runtime can hit limits. Prefer interpreters (JsonLogic.Net, NCalc) or verify your engine has an interpreter mode on IL2CPP. ([Unity Documentation][19])
* **RulesEngine on IL2CPP**: RulesEngine uses expression trees and optional fast expression compilation. It may be fine, but **test on device**; if you see expression‑compile issues, fall back to NCalc/JsonLogic.Net for conditions and keep RulesEngine for rule wiring—or run RulesEngine in a server process if needed. ([Microsoft GitHub][2])
* **Input layer**: Stick with Unity’s **Input System** for device coverage; it’s the canonical source and plays well with UniRx. ([GitHub][12])

---

## JSON + Newtonsoft notes

* Unity has an official **Newtonsoft.Json** package (`com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`). It maps to Json.NET 13.x and works across platforms. ([Unity Documentation][20])
* **JSON Schema**:

  * **Newtonsoft.Json.Schema** is AGPL/commercial—great product, but not open‑source for most commercial use. ([newtonsoft.com][8])
  * **NJsonSchema** is MIT and integrates nicely when you’re already using Json.NET. ([GitHub][6])
* **JSONPath** queries are built into Json.NET (`SelectToken`, `SelectTokens`) if you want to dereference event payloads dynamically from your rule context. ([newtonsoft.com][21])

---

## A sensible starting blueprint

* **Events:** Input System → wrap to Observables with UniRx/R3 → publish on MessagePipe topics. ([GitHub][12])
* **Rules:** Keep JSON rules in `StreamingAssets` (or a remote store). Validate with NJsonSchema at load. Feed events + context into RulesEngine (or JsonLogic/NCalc) to evaluate `conditions`. ([GitHub][6], [Microsoft GitHub][2])
* **Actions:** Map rule “actions” to Unity components/services (registered and resolved via your DI of choice). Use MessagePipe to broadcast results so UI/gameplay systems remain decoupled. ([GitHub][4])

If you want, I can sketch a minimal Unity sample (folder layout, example JSON for RulesEngine vs. JsonLogic, and the C# glue that binds Input→Rules→Actions) using only these libraries.
